#### Description:

According to Brazilian law, every purchase by the government must be made through a bidding process. There are several
modalities of this process, but among them is the preg√£o. This is the simplest and most widely used. 
    During this process, two legal documents are issued, in theory. It happens that, due to the quantity of processes, the
issuing of these documents ends up being a repetitive task, since little information is changed between one document and another. 
    In this scenario, the idea of Gerpar (Opinion Generator) arose, in which the user inserts only the essential
information through a web form and is returned the two opinions already filled out with the indicated information. 

## üößIts construction 

    How it is built.
	The front-end is made with HTML and CSS. It has two pages. On the first page there is the web form where the user
enters the information to be inserted in the documents. On the second page there are options to download the files from the generated legal documents. 
    The back-end uses the Flask framework, written in Python, and the Python script that produces the new legal documents. 
    The script makes use of the python-docx library, which allows Python to work on DOCX documents.
